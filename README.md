# rebellioncoaching_public
Public Version


Open Azure Cloud Shell

Looks like no need to run this since its already been run:
matt@Azure:~$ git clone https://github.com/TheBrainCache/rebellioncoaching_public.git
fatal: destination path 'rebellioncoaching_public' already exists and is not an empty directory.

Tell Git who you are...maybe only necessary to do once??
git config --global user.email "matt@thebraincache.com"
git config --global user.name "Matt Schilb"

cd rebellioncoaching_public

Why does this show extra text (rebellioncoaching_public) after index.html????

matt@Azure:~/rebellioncoaching_public$ ls
index.html  README.md  rebellioncoaching_public
matt@Azure:~/rebellioncoaching_public$
